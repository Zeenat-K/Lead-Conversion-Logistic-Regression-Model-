Developed **Logistic Regression model** to assign lead scores aiding X Education in targeting potential leads, achieving **83%** conversion rate on test set.

Methodologies used:

* Data Cleaning and Preparation: Eliminated redundant variables, handled missing values, and created dummy variables for categorical features.
* Model Building: Employed Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and p-value analysis to select significant features. Achieved 84% area under ROC curve.
* Insights Gained: Identified key lead points for optimal conversion, including occupation, time spent on website, and lead source.
